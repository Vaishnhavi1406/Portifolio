<h1>About my reading habits</h1>
<h4>Let me say about my reading habits....</h4>
<p>I am bit of choosy type. In other words unless I check about the book's reviews on goodreads or on someone else's blog I won't read it. 
I like all kind of books apart from pirate books. Last year I read a lot of books (More than ten). I mostly like series (books that has a sequle). 
Below are my favorite books. Near to that you can go to the next page or go back to about me page.</p>
